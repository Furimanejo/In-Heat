# In Heat
Application to control sex toys based on the user's performance in Overwatch (On-fire Meter)

## How It Works
In Heat uses the Buttplug library (https://buttplug.io/). Buttplug is an open-source standards and software project for controlling intimate hardware, including sex toys, fucking machines, and more.

Here's a list of suported devices: https://iostindex.com/?filter0ButtplugSupport=7

In Heat is a Buttplug client and must connect to a Buttplug server https://intiface.com/desktop/) to work.
